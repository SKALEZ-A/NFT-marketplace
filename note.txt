	========================	NFT      ============================
	Basic Nft, Random IPFS Nft, Dynamic SVG Nft

- install hardhat and all other dependencies
- add .env file 
- add the BasicNft file in the contracts folder
- add functions from hip-721 to Nft contract, install openzeppelin contracts 
- add the helper-hardhat-config.js, deploy folder and utils/verify folder
- create a test folder and write test 
- create file for writing RandomIpfsNft contract inside the contracts folder 

//	Using RandomIpfsNft we are building a completely randomized Nft that users will mint randomly according to rarity
	users will pay for their Nft to the contract

-	using chainlinkVrf to get random number that will be used to get a random Nft having different rarity
-   create .sol file for writing RandomIpfsNft contract 
-	add chainlink/contracts 
* Mapping chainlinkVrf requests

* Using IPFS and Pinata to store NFT metadata
	- add a script to uploadToPinata in utils folder
	- install pinata/sdk, path
	- using pinFileToIpfs and pinJsonToIpfs to upload file and metadata
	- create test folder under contracts and add vrfCoordinatorV2Mock 
	- write test 
NB: In order to work with pinata, we need API and SECRET_KEY
	Before deploying to testnet, write test

* Random IPFS Nft hosting
	Pros: cheap
	Cons: Someone needs to pin our data
* Dynamic SVG On-chain Nft
	Pros: the data is on chain and doesn't need anyone to pin it.
	Cons: they're much more expensive
		--creating an Nft that changes in respect to certain price of eth
	- create a DynamicNft.sol file to write contract
	- convert the svg image to base64 which is needed in order to convert to Uri
		- In order to view our base64 svg as image we use:
			data:image/svg+xml;base64,the base64 string 

NB: call- is how we call functions to change the state of the blockchain
	staticcall- this is how (at a low level) we do our "pure" and "view" functions and potentially don't change the state of the blockchain

- create deploy script that mints Nft for all the contracts
Requirements:
	The price of the Nft 
	The arts
